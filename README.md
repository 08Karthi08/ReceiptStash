# Bugs
1. The tip part needed to be scanned properly. When I tried different receipts, some parts with the light font or text next to a logo/visuals needed to be fixed. -fixed
2. Vendor name is printed differently on different receipts. Most of them use their logo. It's difficult to extract from the receipts.
