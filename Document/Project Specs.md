# Receipt Stash

## Description: 
The web app aims to provide a centralized platform for storing
and managing receipts and helps users keep their financial records
organized and easily accessible.


This project aims to develop a user-friendly Python web app that serves as a
centralized platform for individuals to conveniently upload, store, and
organize their receipts digitally. This web app will provide a way for users to
manage their receipts by providing a seamless and efficient solution.
The web app will feature a clean graphical user interface that ensures a
smooth user experience. The web app dashboard will provide a
comprehensive overview of all their stored receipts, enabling them to easily
access and manage their digital receipts with just a few clicks.


To design the process of digitizing receipts, the project will incorporate
Tesseract, an Optical Character Recognition library, into the web app.
Tesseract will enable the system to automatically extract relevant information
from the scanned receipts, such as vendor name, date, and total amount.
This eliminates time-consuming manual data entry and saves users valuable
time and effort. The web app will also provide options for users to edit, delete, filter, and download their receipts
effectively. 

Overall, this project aims to develop a user-friendly Python web app that
helps users digitally manage their receipts with ease.
